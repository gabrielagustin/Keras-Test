# Keras-Test

Deep Learning using the Keras framework


The idea is to start testing Keras by replicating or improving what has been done using scikit-learn  (multi-layer perceptron as regressor) and start optimizing it. 

Dependences:

    python - Pandas
    python - NumPy
    python - Matplolib
    python - Keras
